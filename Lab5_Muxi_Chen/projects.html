            <h2>1. Prototype 1</h2>
            <h3>Software Technology Review</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensor Design</strong>: Select heart rate sensors, electromyography (EMG) sensors, and plant moisture sensors to collect user physiological data and monitor plant growth conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: The combination of these sensors enables real-time monitoring and analysis of user interactions with plants.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Interface Code (Processing)</h3>
            <p>Use Processing to code the user interface, showcasing real-time data and interactive features. Key functions include setting up the interface, drawing data, and handling user input.</p>

            <h3>Connecting the Three Sensors (Arduino Component)</h3>
            <p>Design a connection scheme for electronic components to ensure the device operates correctly and transmits data. Use serial communication to facilitate data exchange between the device and the computer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Hardware Design</h2>
            <p>The device draws inspiration from the concept of symbiotic interaction design, employing a backpack-style wearable design. A transparent fish tank is chosen as the plant growth environment for easy user observation. Integrate the plants with electronic components to enhance user experience.</p>
